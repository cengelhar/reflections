When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  This would be helpful for a number of reasons:
  
    - If you are working from more than one computer
    - If other people are contributing to the project
    - If you'd like to create an open-source project
    - To create a redundant copy of your project in case your local machine breaks, etc.
