What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository, it generates a .git, which is used to track the files in that repository

    This is important so you can track the changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is unique because it offers a middle spot between the local and git locations. It is valuable
    because it offers a spot to differentiate which files should be include in a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    It is always a good idea to check the difference between staging and the last commit to assure that what you're
    committing is actually what you want to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

    It would be helpful if you want to make a separate version of your master branch or to experiment with large-scale changes
