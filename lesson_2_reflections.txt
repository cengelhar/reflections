What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository, it generates a .git, which is used to track the files in that repository

    This is important so you can track the changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is unique because it offers a middle spot between the local and git locations. It is valuable
    because it offers a spot to differentiate which files should be include in a commit.
